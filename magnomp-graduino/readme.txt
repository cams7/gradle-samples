This script provides a command line interface for compiling and uploading Arduino
sketches. It tries to mimic the standard Arduino IDE behaviour, with two exceptions:
  1. It won't do any magic on your source code. It means no function prototype being
     generated and you'll have to #include "Arduino.h" on your sketch file.
  2. It won't compile a file that haven't been changed since the last compilation. The
     IDE always compile ALL your sketch files + ALL Arduino core files + ALL libraries
     you're using. This is why compiling takes so long.

The script will provide you three Gradle tasks:
  1. build -> Will compile and link your sketch and all necessary Arduino files. You can
     use the -Pverbose switch to see all the commands executed under the hoods.
  2. upload -> build AND upload to the Arduino board. You can use the -Pverbose switch
     to see all the commands executed under the hoods. The upload task depends on build
     task, so you don't need to issue a build before an upload.
  3. clean -> Clean all the files generated by the build.

Exemples:
> gradle build
> gradle upload
> gradle clean upload
> gradle build -Pverbose
> gradle upload -Pverbose

Files:
  1. arduino.gradle -> This is where the tasks are implemented. Normaly you should not
     edit this file in any way.
  2. properties.gradle -> Where you define things that are specific about your
     environment, like the folder where the Arduini IDE is installed, the port used to
     communicate with Arduino, etc. This file should not go into version control systems
     as it's content are specific to each machine.
  3. build.gradle -> This is your build file, where you can implement whatever you want
     which is related to your project.

Configuring:
  1. Edit the properties.gradle following the instructions contained on the file.
  2. Edit the build.gradle following the instructions contained on the file.
  3. Put build.gradle, arduino.gradle and properties.gradle on the same folder where the
     main sketch file is located.
